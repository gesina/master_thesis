\chapter{Formulation of the Immersion Conjecture}
\label{chap:reformulation}
% Explain carefully how the immersion problem can be reformulated purely
% in terms of homotopy theory. [immersionconj] (The necessary results from differential
% topology and Hirsch-Smale theory should be stated clearly but may be
% presented without proofs.)
This chapter is dedicated to reviewing the concepts and results,
which are needed to formulate the immersion conjecture and its
connection to the theory of characteristic classes.

The (re)formulation in \autoref{sec:reformulation} uses as main
ingredient a theorem by Hirsch and Smale on the relation between
immersions and vector bundle monomorphisms presented in
\autoref{sec:hirschsmale}.
This, together with other required definitions and properties of
immersions, is contained in \autoref{sec:immersions}.
Thereafter, in \autoref{sec:charclsofvb}, characteristic classes of vector
bundles are reviewed. Most importantly, the Stiefel-Whitney
characteristic classes are recalled in \autoref{sec:swclasses},
together with an outline of the way these will be particularly
useful throughout this thesis.
The last section then contains an explanation on how they contribute
to the immersion problem via obstructions.

This chapter is meant as revision and outline, therefore a
couple of preliminary results are merely referenced without proof.

\section{Immersions}\label{sec:immersions}
This section recapitulates the definition some properties
of immersions.

\subsection{Definition}
As already mentioned, immersions are technically local embeddings of
manifolds.
From a different point of view, immersions are merely a special case
of monomorphisms of vector bundles. So, recall that a morphism
$(\xi_1\colon\E_1\to X_1)\to(\xi_2\colon E_2\to X_2)$ 
of vector bundles over different spaces is a map $F\colon E_1\to E_2$
which is linear on fibres, and that covers its restriction to the zero
section, \idest it makes the following diagram commute
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    E_1 \ar[r,"F"]\ar[d, "\xi_1"]
    & E_2 \ar[d, "\xi_2"]
    \\
    X_1 \ar[r, "F|_{\zerosec{\xi_1}}"]
    & X_2
  \end{tikzcd}.
\end{center}
Further, remember the fact that such a morphism is a monomorphism in
the category of vector bundles if and only if its restriction to each
fibre is injective.
\begin{Def}
  A smooth map $f\colon M\to N$ of smooth manifolds is called
  an \emph{immersion}, written $M\immto N$, if its differential
  $\Diff f\colon\T M\to\T N$ is a monomorphism of vector
  bundles.
  A homotopy $H\colon M\times I\to N$ which is an immersion in each
  stage is called \emph{regular}.
\end{Def}
\begin{Rem}
  Let $M$ and $N$ be manifolds.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Immersions are local embeddings of manifolds, \idest for an
    immersion $f\colon M\immto N$, around every point in $M$
    there is an open neighbourhood on which $f$ is a diffeomorphism
    onto its image.
    More descriptive, immersions are mappings that do not allow creases,
    respectively sharp bends, or puncturing
    (see \forexample \cite{outsidein} for nicely illustrated examples)
    However, globally, immersions need not be injective since
    \forexample self-intersections of the image are allowed.
    \begin{proof}
      This is a conclusion from the implicit function theorem,
      see \forexample \cite[Chap.~1, Theorem~3.1]{hirsch}.
    \end{proof}
  \item Embeddings of manifolds are exactly those injective immersions
    that are topological embeddings.
    If $M$ is compact, any injective immersion $f\colon M\to N$ is an
    embedding.
    \begin{proof}
      % Argumentation:
      % Every manifold has Riemannian metric
      % Every Riemannian manifold is a metric space, topologies agree
      % For metric spaces, sequentially compact is equivalent to compact
      Use the fact that for manifolds compact is equivalent to
      sequentially compact, in order to get
      \begin{gather*}
        \left\{
          y=\lim_n f(x_n) \,\middle|\,
          (x_n)_{n\in\Nat}\subset M \text{ without limit}
        \right\} \cap M = \emptyset
      \end{gather*}
      directly from injectivity of $f$, and compactness of $M$ and
      $f(M)$.
      Then apply \cite[Chap.~II, Lemma~2.6]{adachi}.
    \end{proof}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Rem}

\subsection{The Hirsch-Smale Theorem}\label{sec:hirschsmale}
It is easy to see that in general not all vector bundle monomorphisms
between tangent bundles of smooth manifolds need to be the
differential of an immersion. However, taking the differential gives a
canonical inclusion of the set of immersions into the set of vector
bundle monomorphisms.
A theorem of Hirsch and Smale states that this inclusion
actually is a homotopy equivalence,
translating questions on the existence of immersions into the context
of characteristic classes of vector bundles.

For the formulation, one has to equip the respective sets with a
topology as follows.
\begin{Def}
  Let $M$, $N$ be closed smooth manifolds of dimensions $\dim M<\dim N$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Equip the set of all vector bundle monomorphisms from $\xi_1$ to
    $\xi_2$ with the compact-open topology (see \forexample
    \cite{hatcher}), and denote that space by $\Mono{\xi_1}{\xi_2}$.
    Note that a path between monomorphisms $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the
    space $\Mono \xi \eta$ is an homotopy from $F_1$ to $F_2$ which is
    a vector bundle monomorphism in each stage.
  \item
    % compare Lecture_Notes_on_Immersions_of_Surfaces_in_3-Space--Nowik.ps
    % Whitney $C^r$-topology; see [Hirsch, Differential Topology, Chap 2, p.35]
    The set $\Imm M N$ of all immersions from $M$ to $N$ injects
    into $\Mono{\T M}{\T N}$ by taking the differential
    $f\mapsto\Diff f$.
    Equip $\Imm M N$ in the following with the subspace topology.
    This results in the weak topology described in
    \cite[Section~2.1]{hirsch}, which equals the Whitney
    $C^1$-topology since $M$ was chosen compact.
    By the way, $\Imm M N$ is open in $C^1(M,N)$ equipped with the
    Whitney $C^1$-topology
    (see \cite[Section~2.1, Theorem~1.1]{hirsch}).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Def}

Now one can state the major result in immersion theory by
Hirsch using preliminary work of Smale
\cite[Sections~5 and 6]{hirschimmersions}.
The following formulation is according to
\cite[Theorem~1.2]{immersionconj}.
\begin{Thm}[Hirsch-Smale]\label{thm:hirschsmale}
  Let $M$, $N$ be closed manifolds with $\dim M<\dim N$.
  Then the differential map
  $\Diff\colon \Imm M N\to \Mono{\T M}{\T N}$
  induces isomorphisms on the homotopy groups.
  Especially,
  \begin{gather*}
    \Diff_*\colon
    \pi_0(\Imm M N) \overset\sim\longto \pi_0(\Mono{\T M}{\T N})
  \end{gather*}
  describes an isomorphism of path-connected components.
  % Original formulation by Hirsch in [hirschimmersions], sec. 5:
  Therefore, every vector bundle monomorphism
  $F\colon\T M\to\T N$ is homotopic (through vector bundle
  monomorphisms) to a monomorphism which is the differential
  $\Diff f$ of a smooth map $f\colon M\to N$, \idest of an
  immersion.
  \begin{proof}
    See \cite[Theorem~8.2.1]{introductionhprinciple} or the original
    paper \cite{hirschimmersions}.
  \end{proof}
\end{Thm}
Thus, any monomorphism of vector bundles over smooth, closed manifolds
$M$ and $N$ implies the existence of an immersion from $M$ to $N$.
This conclusion will be needed to reformulate the immersion problem.


\subsection{Normal Bundles}
Another nice property of immersions is that every immersion gives
rise to a normal bundle. This will finally make it possible to
translate the existence of an immersion of certain codimension into
the existence of a vector bundle of certain rank fulfilling a homotopy
invariant lifting property.
\begin{Def}
  Let $\imm\colon M^n\immto N^{n+r}$ be an immersion of smooth
  manifolds.
  The \emph{normal bundle $\N{\emb}$ of $\imm$}
  is the well-defined, quotient bundle $\pb{\imm}\T N/\T M$ of rank $r$,
  respectively the one fulfilling
  $\N{\imm}\oplus\T M\cong\pb{\imm}\T N$.
\end{Def}
Recall that manifolds have the very handy property that they admit a
unique tangent bundle.
Similarly, a normal bundle of an immersion into Euclidean space is
unique up to a notion of stable equivalence, under which
characteristic classes will turn out to be invariant.
\begin{Def}
  Call two vector bundles $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$ over the same space 
  \emph{stably equivalent} in case there are $s_1, s_2\in\Nat$ such
  that $\xi_1\oplus\trivbdl^{s_1}\cong\xi_2\oplus\trivbdl^{s_2}$.
\end{Def}
Now the promised notion of the stable normal bundle can be clarified.
\begin{LemDef}
  Let $M^n$ be a closed, smooth manifold.
  Then all normal bundles of immersions of $M$ into
  Euclidean spaces are stably equivalent.
  The resulting equivalence class is called the
  \emph{stable normal bundle of $M$}, written $\N M$.
  When working with vector bundles in a context that is stable in the
  above sense, like \forexample characteristic classes, the stable
  normal bundle of $M$ may be identified with an arbitrary
  representative of its class.
  \begin{proof}[proof (sketch)]
    First show that every normal bundle of an immersion is stably
    equivalent to the 
    normal bundle of \emph{some} embedding (\idest some injective
    immersion). Then ensure that all normal bundles of embeddings are
    stably equivalent.
    \begin{description}
    \item[Immersions]
      Any immersion $\imm\colon M\immto\R^{n+r}$ can be raised to
      higher codimension by concatenation with the linear embedding
      $l\colon\R^{n+r}\immto\R^{n+r+s}$ into the first components.
      As the normal bundles $\N{\imm}$ and
      $\N{l\circ\imm}\cong\N{\imm}\oplus\trivbdl^s$ are stably
      equivalent, raising the codimension does not change the stable
      equivalence class.
      Furthermore, since a regular homotopy yields an
      isomorphism on the normal bundles, it suffices to show:
      \begin{claim}
        For $r>n$ every immersion $M\immto\R^{n+r}$ is regularly
        homotopic to an embedding.
      \end{claim}
      For the claim use bumping techniques
      %as needed for the Thom transversality theorem
      to show that for $r>n$ every
      immersion $\imm\colon M\immto\R^{n+r}$ is regularly homotopic to
      an injective immersion
      (see \forexample \cite[Chap.~II, Lemma~2.5]{adachi}).
      However, as $M$ is compact, injective immersions
      are embeddings.
    \item[Embeddings]
      By Whitney's embedding theorem
      (see \forexample \cite[Chap.~II.2]{adachi})
      it is known that every manifold admits an embedding into some
      real space.
      Further, by \forexample the General Position theorem
      (compare \cite[Chap.~2]{embeddingsummary})
      or Haefliger's theorem (see \forexample \cite[Chap.~II.1]{adachi}),
      it is known that for sufficiently large $k\in\Nat$ all embeddings
      $M\immto\R^{n+k}$ are isotopic, \idest homotopic through embeddings,
      and hence their normal bundles are isomorphic.
      Therefore, all normal bundles of embeddings of a manifold are
      stably equivalent.
      \qedhere
    \end{description}
  \end{proof}
\end{LemDef}

\section{Characteristic Classes of Vector Bundles}\label{sec:charclsofvb}
The theory of characteristic classes provides the key tools
for the rest of this thesis. Therefore, this section
revises basic results, and recalls in detail several properties
of Stiefel-Whitney classes. The latter are generators of all
characteristic classes of vector bundles, and will be essential in
proving the theorems of the subsequent chapters.

\subsection{General Definition and Properties}
Before starting off with the definition of characteristic classes,
we recall the definition of universal bundles and Steenrod's
classification theorem (compare \cite[Chapter~14.4]{tomdieck}).
\begin{LemDef}\label{def:charcls}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Any topological group $G$ admits a contractible space $\EG$ with a
    free $G$-action, and a corresponding principal $G$-bundle
    $\gamma^G\colon \EG\to\BG\coloneqq \EG/G$, called the
    \emph{universal $G$-bundle},
    where $\gamma_G$, $\EG$, and $\BG$ are all unique up to
    homotopy.
    $\BG$ is called the \emph{classifying space} for principal
    $G$-bundles.
    For construction and uniqueness see \cite[Example~1B.7~ff.]{hatcher},
    respectively note that universal coverings are unique up to homotopy.
  \item\label{item:classificationthm}
    $\gamma^G$ fulfils the following universal property:
    For any space $X$ admitting the homotopy type of a CW-complex
    there is a bijection between $[X,\BG]$, which denotes the homotopy
    classes of maps from $X$ to $\BG$, and the isomorphism classes of
    principal $G$-bundles over $X$, given by
    \begin{gather*}
      \left(f\colon X\to\BG \right) \longmapsto \pb f \gamma^G
      \;.
    \end{gather*}
    This correspondence is natural in $X$, and is a version of
    Steenrod's classification theorem
    (see 
    \cite[Theorem~14.4.1]{tomdieck},
    \cite[Theorem~1.4, p.~75]{immersionconj}).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{LemDef}
As becomes clear directly from the statement, the classifying
theorem serves in translating bundle theoretic problems into homotopy
theoretic ones, which will be a crucial step in reformulating the
immersion problem in \autoref{sec:reformulation}.
Such homotopy theoretic questions can then be tackled using known
cohomological tools, which yields the general concept of
characteristic classes.
Some important examples for vector bundles, namely the
Stiefel-Whitney classes, will be discussed in detail in
\autoref{sec:swclasses}.
\begin{Def}
  A \emph{characteristic class}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item of degree $i$
  \item with coefficients in a ring $R$
  \item for principal $G$-bundles for a group $G$
  \end{itemize}
  is a natural transformation
  \begin{gather*}
    \Cl\colon [-, \BG] \Longrightarrow \H^i(-; R)\;.
  \end{gather*}
  of contravariant functors from the category of spaces with the
  homotopy type of a CW-complex to the category of sets.
\end{Def}
\begin{Rem}
  By Brown's representation theorem
  (see \forexample \cite[Chap.~4.E]{hatcher}),
  $\H^i(-;R)$ is a representable functor represented by the
  Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(i,R)$.
  Thus, by the Yoneda lemma, a characteristic class is
  represented by a morphism
  \begin{gather*}
    \cl\colon \BG \longto K(i, R)
  \end{gather*}
  in $\Top$, \idest by a cohomology class $\cl$ of $\BG$.
  Thus, for a space $X$, which admits the homotopy type of a
  CW-complex, 
  applying $\Cl$ to a principal $G$-bundle over $X$ that is
  represented by a morphism $\eta\colon X\to\BG$
  as in Definition~\itemref{def:charcls}{item:classificationthm},
  yields
  \begin{gather*}
    \Cl(X) = \pb{\eta} \cl \in \H^i(X;R)
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
  This describes a one-to-one correspondence between
  characteristic classes as above and cohomology classes in
  $\H^i(BG;R)$, and in the following any characteristic class will be
  identified with its corresponding cohomology class.
\end{Rem}

As this thesis is mainly concerned with vector bundles, we have a
closer look at the significance of classifying spaces in that context,
especially at their stability property and its implications for normal
bundles.
\begin{Lem}\label{lem:classificationvb}
  Let $X$ be any space, let $M^n$ be a manifold, and $r,s\in\Nat$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:vbcharacterisation}
    There is a natural equivalence between the category of
    $n$-dimensional vector bundles and that of principal
    $\Orth(n)$- respectively $\GL n$-bundles, where $\Orth(n)$ is the
    $n$-dimensional real orthogonal group, and $\Orth$ their limit
    correspondingly, \idest the group of all orthogonal matrices over
    $\R$.
  \item\label{item:boincl}
    The inclusion $\B\Orth(r)\to\B\Orth(r+s)$ is $r$-connected.
  \item\label{item:bomaps}
    On vector bundles, the inclusion $\B\Orth(r)\to\B\Orth(r+s)$
    represents the direct sum with the trivial bundle $\trivbdl^s$.
    \Idest for vector bundles $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ over $X$ with
    classifying maps $f_1$ respectively $f_2$, there is a lift up to
    homotopy of the form
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        X \ar[r, "f_1"]
        \ar[dr, bend right, "f_2"{left}]
        & \B\Orth(r)
        \ar[d, "\incl"]
        \\
        & \B\Orth(r+s)
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    if and only if $\xi_1\oplus\trivbdl^{s}\cong\xi_2$.
  \item\label{item:charclsstablenormalbundle}
    Taking the limit of all classifying maps of the normal bundles of
    embeddings of $M$ yields a homotopy class in
    $[M,\B\Orth=\varinjlim_{k}\B\Orth(k)]$
    that classifies the stable normal bundle of $M$ uniquely.
    Any lift of it in $[M,\B\Orth(r)]$ represents a vector bundle
    $\N{}$ with the property $\N{}\oplus\T M\cong\trivbdl^{n+r}$.
  \end{enumerate}  
  \begin{proof}[proof]
    The natural equivalence is given by the known construction of
    associated vector bundles, and the stability property of the
    family $(\B\Orth(n))_n$ becomes clear from
    $\B\Orth(n)\cong\lim_{k\to\infty}G_n(\R^k)$ 
    where $G_n(\R^k)$ is the Grassmann manifold of $n$-dimensional
    vector subspaces of $\R^k$.

    For the $r$-connectivity in \ref{item:boincl}, observe that
    the diagram
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=small, column sep=small]
        \Orth(r) \ar[r]\ar[d,"\incl"{near start}]
        &\E\Orth(r) \ar[r] \ar[d,"\incl"{near start}]
        &\BO(r) \ar[d,"\incl"{near start}] \\
        \Orth(r+1) \ar[r]\ar[d]
        &\E\Orth(r+1) \ar[r]
        &\BO(r+1) \\
        \Sphere{r}
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    commutes, where the rows are the defining fibre bundles for the
    classifying spaces, and $\Orth(r)\to\Orth(r+1)\to\Sphere r$
    is the well-known fibre bundle of the inclusion of orthogonal groups.
    Since $\E\Orth(s)$ is contractible for any $s\in\Nat$, 
    the long exact sequences of homotopy for the horizontal fibre bundles yield
    $\pi_i(\Orth(r))\cong\pi_{i+1}(\BO(r))$ for $i\in\Nat$, analogously for $r+1$.
    The sequence for the vertical fibre bundle yields that
    $\Orth(r)\to\Orth(r+1)$ is $r$-connected, and commutativity gives
    the same for $\incl\colon\BO(r)\to\BO(r+1)$.
    
    For the lifting property of the stable normal bundle, consider a
    lift $\N{}\in[M,\BO(r)]$, $r>1$, by \ref{item:vbcharacterisation}
    classifying a vector bundle over $M$, which we will also call
    $\N{}$. By \ref{item:bomaps} and the definition
    of the stable normal bundle, there is some $s\in\Nat$
    such that $\T M\oplus\N{}\oplus\trivbdl^s\cong\trivbdl^{n+r+s}$.
    Assume $s>0$.
    In order to show that this still implies
    $\T M\oplus\N{}\cong\trivbdl^{n+r}$ (\idest that their
    classifying maps are homotopic), consider the corresponding
    homotopy commutative diagram of classifying maps
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        M
        \ar[r, "\T M\oplus\N{}", shift left]
        \ar[r, "\trivbdl^{n+r}"{below}, shift right]
        \ar[dr, bend right, "\trivbdl^{n+r+s}"{left}]
        & \B\Orth(n+r)
        \ar[d, "\incl"]
        \\
        & \B\Orth(n+r+s)
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    This says that $\incl\circ\T M\oplus\N{}$ and
    $\incl\circ\trivbdl^{n+r}$ must be homotopic via
    some homotopy
    \begin{gather*}
      H\colon M\times I\to\BO(n+r+s) \;.
    \end{gather*}
    The trick now is to use that by Morse theory $M$ has the homotopy
    type of an $n$-dimensional CW-complex, together with $\incl$ being
    $(n+r)$-connected, $r>0$, and both $\BO(n+r+s)$ and $\BO(n+r)$
    being path-connected. Because with these assumptions
    obstruction theory yields that
    $H$ lifts to a homotopy $M\times I\to\BO(n+r)$ between
    the classifying maps of $\T M\oplus\N{}$ and $\trivbdl^{n+r}$, as
    was needed
    (see \forexample \cite[Lemma~4.6]{hatcher}).
  \end{proof}
\end{Lem}
\begin{Not}
  Throughout this thesis assume $R=\Zmod2$ and $G=\Orth(n)$
  respectively $G=\Orth$ if not stated otherwise.
\end{Not}

\subsection{Stiefel-Whitney Classes}
\label{sec:swclasses}
Now that the general concept is known, this section reviews the
defining and immediate properties of the Stiefel-Whitney
classes, a generating set for the ring $\H^*(\BO)$ of characteristic
classes of vector bundles.
This makes them especially interesting for investigation,
as any property stable under cohomology ring operations only needs to
be checked on the generating set.
Furthermore, they will be invaluable for constructing new
characteristic classes used as obstructions or indicators.
More precisely, their duals, their inverses under certain Steenrod
operations called Wu classes, and a couple of special polynomials
evaluated on them will be used.

First start with the defining properties of the Stiefel-Whitney
classes. Compare \forexample \cite[compare §4, p.~37]{milnor}.
\begin{Def}\label{def:swclasses}
  The \emph{Stiefel-Whitney classes} are
  characteristic classes for principal $\Orth$-bundles
  respectively vector bundles,
  \idest cohomology classes
  $\ws{i}\in \H^i(\BO;\Zmod2)$, $i\in\Nat$,
  fulfilling the following properties for any vector bundles $\xi$ and
  $\eta$ over a space $B$, and any map $f\colon A\to B$ of spaces:
  \begin{axioms}
  \axiom[Naturality] $\pb f\w{i}{\xi} = \w{i}{\pb f \xi}$,
  \axiom $\w{0}{\xi}=1$,
  \axiom $\W{\gamma_1} = 1 + x$,
  \axiom[Multiplicativity]\label{tag:swclassesmultiplicativity}
  $\W{\xi \oplus \eta} = \W{\xi}\cup \W{\eta}$
    \\\idest in degree $n$ we have
    $\w{n}{\xi\oplus\eta} = \sum_{i+j=n}\w{i}{\xi} \cup \w{j}{\eta}$,
  \end{axioms}
  where the \emph{total Stiefel-Whitney class}
  $\Ws\coloneqq\sum_{i\geq 0}\ws{i}$ is the formal sum of all
  Stiefel-Whitney classes,
  $\gamma_1$ is the tautological line bundle over $\RP 1$,
  $\RPinf\cong\BO(1)\to\BO$,
  and $x$ is the%
  \footnote{
    This is well-defined: A ring $R$ of the form $\Zmod2[x]$
    with $\deg(x)=1$ only admits two elements in degree~1, $0$ and a
    generator. Therefore, there exists exactly one ring
    isomorphism, and this sends the unique generator in
    degree 1 to $x$.
  }
  generator of $\H^*(\RPinf;\Zmod2)\cong\Zmod2[x]$.
\end{Def}
Note that naturality is already implied by the requirements for a
characteristic class. However, given only the above axioms:
\begin{Thm}
  Stiefel-Whitney classes exist and are uniquely defined by the above
  properties. Furthermore, they generate the ring
  $\H^*(\BO;\Zmod2)$, which is isomorphic to $\Zmod2[\ws{i}|i\geq1]$.
  \begin{proof}[proof]
      A possible concrete construction utilises the Euler
      class. For a definition via Steenrod squares can be 
      found in Theorem~\ref{thm:altdefswclasses}.
      For uniqueness see \cite[Uniqueness Theorem~7.3]{milnor}.
      For the generating property see \forexample
      \cite[Theorem~7.1~ff.]{milnor}, or \cite[Chap.~7.6]{may}.
  \end{proof}
\end{Thm}

As already mentioned, the above generating property means that every
characteristic class of vector bundles of a fixed dimension can be
represented as a certain combination of Stiefel-Whitney classes.
Moreover, they---and hence all characteristic classes---behave
extremely well with respect to vector bundle operations as emphasised
below.
\begin{Rem}
  \label{rem:propswclasses}
  Let $\xi$, $\eta$ be vector bundles over a space $X$.
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item\label{item:propswclasses:dimesioncut} $\w{i}{\eta} = 0$
    for any vector bundle $\eta$ with $\rk\eta < i$.
    Therefore, the total Stiefel-Whitney class $\W{\xi}$ is
    well-defined (\idest the sum is finite)
    for any vector bundle $\xi$ of finite rank.
    \begin{proof}
      See \cite[Sec.~19.4]{tomdieck}.
    \end{proof}
  \item\label{item:swoftrivbdl}
    $\w{i}{\trivbdl}=0$ for $i>0$, and one immediately concludes
    from multiplicativity:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{item:swclassesstable}
      The Stiefel-Whitney classes are stable, \idest
      $\w{i}{\xi\oplus\trivbdl} = \w{i}{\xi}$, which once more proves
      the stability property of characteristic classes of vector bundles.
      Thus, for a manifold $M^n$, all normal bundles $\N{\emb}$ of
      embeddings $\emb\colon M\to\R^{n+k+r}$ share the same
      Stiefel-Whitney classes, written $\W{\N M}$ accordingly.
      Note that $\W{\N M} = \pb{\N{M}}\ws{i}$, where $\N M$ denotes the
      classifying map of the stable normal bundle.
    \item\label{item:wuclassmfdinverse}
      If $\xi\oplus\eta = \trivbdl^{\rk\xi+\rk\eta}$, then
      $\W{\xi}\cup\W{\eta}=1$.
      Especially, for any choice of embedding $\emb\colon M^n\to\R^{n+k}$
      with normal bundle $\N{\emb}$ of a smooth manifold $M$ we have
      $\T M\oplus\N{\emb} = \trivbdl$, and therefore
      $1 = \W{\T M} \cup \W{\N{\emb}} = \W{\T M}\cup\W{\N M}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{proof}
      The trivial rank $n$ bundle over $X$ is defined as the pullback
      $\pb \pi \trivbdl^n$ of the rank $n$ bundle
      $\trivbdl^n\colon \R^n\to\pt$ over the point by the trivial map
      $\pi\colon X\to\pt$. The naturality of the Stiefel-Whitney
      classes gives $\W{\trivbdl^n} = \pb\pi \W{\trivbdl^n}
      \in\pb\pi \left(\H^*(\pt;\Zmod2)\right)$,
      and the result follows from $\H^i(\pt;\Zmod2) = 0$ for $i>0$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Rem}

In order to algebraically work with the Stiefel-Whitney classes, the
formal inverse is often handy. Especially, since it is well-known for
manifolds as explained below.
\begin{Def}
  Define the \emph{dual Stiefel-Whitney (characteristic) classes}
  $\dualws{i}$ in degree $i$ inductively by
  \begin{align*}
    1 &= \dualws{0}\cup\ws{0} = \dualws{0}    &&\text{in degree 0}\\
    0 &= \sum_{i+j=n} \dualws{i}\cup\ws{j}  &&\text{in degree n>0}
  \end{align*}
  With the notation $\dualWs\coloneqq \sum_{i\geq0} \dualws{i}$ as above
  for the formal sum this can be reformulated as
  \begin{gather*}
    1 = \Ws\cup\dualWs
  \end{gather*}
  in the completion of the polynomial ring $\H^*(\BO)\cong\Zmod2[\ws{i}|i\in\Nat]$.
\end{Def}
By
Remark~\itemref{rem:propswclasses}{item:swoftrivbdl}\ref{item:wuclassmfdinverse},
a first example of dual Stiefel-Whitney classes is given by the
canonical tangent and normal bundle of a manifold, which makes them
especially handy in the context relevant for the immersion conjecture.
\begin{Def}
  For a manifold $M$ use the following abbreviation
  \begin{align*}
    \W{M} &\coloneqq \W{\T M}
            \;,
    &\text{and thus}&
    &\dualW{M} &\coloneqq \dualW{\T M} = \W{\N M}
    \;.
  \end{align*}
\end{Def}

\section{Reformulation of the Immersion Conjecture}
\label{sec:reformulation}

The immersion problem can finally be clearly stated with the
definitions from \autoref{sec:immersions}.
The goal of this section is to reformulate the immersion conjecture to
a statement that can be analysed with means of homotopy theory of
vector bundles, and show how characteristic classes relate to this by
finding a powerful obstruction.
The latter will be followed up in the subsequent chapter.

Before reformulating, recall the actual immersion conjecture.
\begin{Def}
  For $n\in\Nat$ consider the unique minimal binary expansion
  \begin{gather*}
    n=2^{i_1}+\dotsb+2^{i_{l_n}},
    \quad\text{with}\quad
    i_1<\dotsb<i_{l_n}
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
  Define $\alpha(n)\coloneqq l_n$, \idest $\alpha(n)$ is the number of
  ones in the binary notation of $n$.
\end{Def}
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:immersionconj}
  For $n\in\Nat$, every closed, smooth, $n$-dimensional manifold
  immerses into $\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}$.
\end{Thm}
In the style of this conjecture, an $n$-manifold that immerses into
some $\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}$ will be said to have the
\emph{immersion property}.
And the question, whether a particular manifold does have the
immersion property, will be referred to as the \emph{immersion problem} for
this manifold.

Recall, that by the Theorem~\ref{thm:hirschsmale} of Hirsch and Smale,
any vector bundle monomorphism between tangent bundles of smooth
manifolds implies the existence of an immersion.
This is the main ingredient for the subsequent reformulation of the
immersion problem.
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:immersionconj:equivalences}
  Let $n,k\in\Nat$ and $M^n$ be a closed, smooth, $n$-dimensional manifold.
  The following statements are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:1}
    $M$ immerses into $\R^{n+k}$.
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:2}
    There is a vector bundle monomorphism $F\colon\T M\to\T{\R^{n+k}}$.
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:3}
    There is a $k$-dimensional vector bundle
    $\N{}\colon\E{\N{}}\to M$ over $M$ with
    \begin{gather*}
      \N{}\oplus\T M\cong\trivbdl^{n+k}
      \;.
    \end{gather*}
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:4}
    For the map $\N M\colon M\to\B\Orth$ classifying the stable
    normal bundle over $M$ there is a lift $\N{}\colon M\to\B\Orth(k)$
    making the following diagram commute up to homotopy
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        M
        \ar[r, "\N{}"]
        \ar[dr, "\N{M}"{left}, bend right]
        & \BO(k) \ar[d, "\incl", hookrightarrow] \\
        & \BO
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}
% From a homotopy theoretical viewpoint, one is most
% interested in statement \ref{item:immersionconj:4}
% because it allows to apply the huge arsenal of characteristic classes
% of vector bundles, an example of which will be discussed in
% \autoref{chap:massey}.

\begin{proof}[proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:immersionconj:equivalences}]
  The strategy is to show
  \ref{item:immersionconj:1}$\Rightarrow$%
  \ref{item:immersionconj:4}$\Rightarrow$%
  \ref{item:immersionconj:3}$\Rightarrow$%
  \ref{item:immersionconj:2}$\Leftrightarrow$%
  \ref{item:immersionconj:1}.
  \begin{description}
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:1}$\Rightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:4}:]
    The classifying map of an immersion's normal bundle
    lifts $\N{M}$ as required,
    using Steenrod's classification theorem
    \itemref{def:charcls}{item:classificationthm} and the properties
    of the stable normal bundle from
    Lemma~\itemref{lem:classificationvb}{item:charclsstablenormalbundle}.
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:4}$\Rightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:3}:]
    Also, by
    Lemma~\itemref{lem:classificationvb}{item:charclsstablenormalbundle},
    any rank $k$ vector bundle that is represented by a lift of
    $\N{M}$ to $[M,\B\Orth(k)]$ as in \ref{item:immersionconj:4},
    has the property needed for \ref{item:immersionconj:3}.
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:3}$\Rightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:2}:]
    % In order to get from a vector bundle monomorphism
    % $F\colon\T M\to\T{\R^{n+k}}$ to a vector bundle dual to the
    % tangent bundle in the sense of \ref{item:immersionconj:3}, note that
    % $\pb f\T{\R^{n+k}}$ for $f=F|_{\zerosec{\T M}}$ is 
    % trivial, and that $F\colon \T M\to \pb f\T{\R^{n+k}}$ is not only
    %% Wrong according to George??
    % fibre-wise, but globally injective of constant rank
    % $\dim M$.
    % Thus, as in the definition of normal bundles,
    % $\N{}\coloneqq\pb f\T{\R^{n+k}}/\T M$ is a vector bundle over $M$
    % that obviously fulfils the required property of
    % \ref{item:immersionconj:3}.
    %
    When given some rank $k$ vector bundle $\N{}$
    such that $\N{}\oplus\T M\cong\trivbdl^{n+k}$, there is a vector
    bundle monomorphism $\T M\to\trivbdl^{n+k}$ over $M$. Then the
    following chain of vector bundle morphisms
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        \T M \ar[d]
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & M\times\R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \ar[r]
        & \pt\times \R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & \R^{n+k}\times \R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \\
        M
        \ar[r,equals]
        & M
        \ar[r]
        & \pt
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & \R^{n+k}
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is fibre-wise injective in each stage, and hence a monomorphism as
    was needed.
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:1}$\Leftrightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:2}:]
    The tricky part is to relate \ref{item:immersionconj:1} and
    \ref{item:immersionconj:2}, even though it is easily seen that
    \ref{item:immersionconj:1} implies \ref{item:immersionconj:2} by
    simply taking $F$ to be the differential $\Diff f$ of the
    immersion from \ref{item:immersionconj:1}.
    
    The converse direction is an application of the Hirsch-Smale
    theorem~\ref{thm:hirschsmale}.
    However, first substitute the non-compact manifold $\R^{n+k}$ with
    the compact sphere $N=\Sphere{n+k}$, to make $M$ and $N$ comply
    with the assumptions of the theorem:
    As $\dim M<n+k$ by assumption,
    the image of $M$ under any immersion $M\to\Sphere{n+k}$ is a
    zero-set by Sard's theorem (see \forexample \cite[Chap.~3,
    Theorem~1.3]{hirsch}), and hence every such immersion misses a
    point in $\Sphere{n+k}$, thus factoring over an immersion
    $M\to\R^{n+k}$.
    This then shows that also \ref{item:immersionconj:2} implies
    \ref{item:immersionconj:1} which makes them equivalent.
    \qedhere
  \end{description}
\end{proof}

This now gives rise to involve the powerful obstruction theory of
characteristic classes of vector bundles as follows.
\begin{Cor}\label{cor:obstruction}
  Let $n,k\in\Nat$, and $M^n$ be a smooth, closed manifold.
  If $M$ immerses into $\R^{n+k}$, then $\dualw{i}{M}=0$ for all
  $i>k$.
  \begin{proof}
    By Theorem~\ref{thm:immersionconj:equivalences} $M$ immerses
    into $\R^{n+k}$ if and only if there is a rank-$k$
    normal bundle $\N{}$ of $M$.
    Since the Stiefel-Whitney classes are stable,
    $\W{\N{}}=\W{\N M}=\dualW{M}$.
    However, as explained in
    Remark~\itemref{rem:propswclasses}{item:propswclasses:dimesioncut},
    all Stiefel-Whitney classes $\w{i}{\N{}}$ of degree $i$ exceeding
    the rank $k$ of $\N{}$ are zero.
  \end{proof}
\end{Cor}
As a result, the immersion conjecture requires that all $n$-manifolds
have vanishing dual Stiefel-Whitney classes in degrees $i>n-\alpha(n)$.
That this is true, is a theorem of Massey which will be proven in
\autoref{chap:massey}. It was an inspiration to state the conjecture
with the value $k=n-\alpha(n)$ in the first place.
