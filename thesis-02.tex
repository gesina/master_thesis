\chapter{Homotopical Formulation of the Immersion Problem}
% Explain carefully how the immersion problem can be reformulated purely
% in terms of homotopy theory. [immersionconj] (The necessary results from differential
% topology and Hirch-Smale theory should be stated clearly but may be pre-
% sented without proofs.)
