\chapter{Homotopy Theoretical Formulation of the Immersion Problem}
% Explain carefully how the immersion problem can be reformulated purely
% in terms of homotopy theory. [immersionconj] (The necessary results from differential
% topology and Hirsch-Smale theory should be stated clearly but may be
% presented without proofs.)

  
Immersions are merely a special case of monomorphisms of vector
bundles. So, recall that
a morphism $(\xi_1\colon\E_1\to X_1)\to(\xi_2\colon E_2\to X_2)$
of vector bundles over different spaces is a map $F\colon E_1\to E_2$
that covers its restriction to the zero section, \idest it makes the
following diagram commute
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    E_1 \ar[r,"F"]\ar[d, "\xi_1"]
    & E_2 \ar[d, "\xi_2"]
    \\
    X_1 \ar[r, "F|_{\zerosec{\xi_1}}"]
    & X_2
  \end{tikzcd}.
\end{center}
Further remember the fact that such a morphism is a monomorphism in
the category of vector bundles $\Vect$, if and only if its restriction
to each fibre is injective.
\begin{Def}
  A (smooth) map $f\colon M\to N$ of smooth manifolds is called
  an \emph{immersion} if its differential
  $\Diff f\colon\T M\to\T N$ is a monomorphism of vector
  bundles.
\end{Def}
Note that not all vector bundle monomorphisms between tangent bundles
of smooth manifolds need to be 

Later, an important result due to Hirsch and Smale will be needed that
relates spaces of immersions and vector bundle monomorphisms.
For the formulation, one has to equip the respective sets with a
topology as follows.
\begin{Def}
  Let $M$, $N$ be closed smooth manifolds of dimensions $\dim M < \dim N$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item % TODO: Whitney $C^r$-topology; see [Hirsch, Differential Topology, Chap 2, p.35]
  \item
    Equip the set of all vector bundle monomorphisms from $\xi_1$ to
    $\xi_2$ with the compact-open topology, and denote that space by
    $\Mono{\xi_1}{\xi_2}$.
    Note that a path between monomorphisms $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the
    space $\Mono \xi \eta$ is an homotopy from $F_1$ to $F_2$ which is
    a vector bundle monomorphism in each stage.
  \item % TODO: (GEORGE) check topology of \Imm(M, N); compare Lecture_Notes_on_Immersions_of_Surfaces_in_3-Space--Nowik.ps
    The set $\Imm M N$ of all immersions from $M$ to $N$ injects
    into $\Mono{\T M}{\T N}$ by taking the differential
    $f\mapsto\Diff f$.
    Equip $\Imm M N$ in the following with the subspace topology.
    This results in the weak topology described in
    \cite[Section~2.1]{hirsch}, which equals the Whitney
    $C^1$-topology since $M$ was chosen compact.
    By the way, $\Imm M N$ is open in $C^1(M,N)$ equipped with the
    Whitney $C^1$-topology
    (see \cite[Section~2.1, Theorem~1.1]{hirsch}),
    and thus not a discrete space.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Def}


\begin{Thm}\label{thm:immersionconj}
  For $n\in\Nat$, every closed, smooth, $n$-dimensional manifold
  immerses into $\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}$, where $\alpha(n)$ is defined as
  the minimal number of summands in any binary representation of $n$.
\end{Thm}

In order to reformulate the above theorem, recall the notion of the
stable normal bundle. 
\begin{LemDef}
  Let $M^n$ be a smooth manifold.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The \emph{normal bundle $\N\iota$ of an embedding}
    $\iota\colon M^n\to N^{n+r}$ of manifolds is the $r$-dimensional
    quotient bundle $\pb\iota\T N/\T M$, respectively the one
    fulfilling $\N\iota\oplus\T M\cong\pb\iota\T N$.
  \item 
    Call normal bundles of embeddings
    $\iota_1\colon M\to\R^{n+r}$, $\iota_2\colon M\to\R^{n+r+s}$
    stably isomorphic in case
    $\N{\iota_1}\oplus\trivbdl^{s}\cong\N{\iota_1}$.
    This also implies that the corresponding classifying map $f_2$ of
    $\N{\iota_2}$ factors over the classifying map $f_1$ of
    $\N{\iota_1}$ as   
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        M \ar[r, "f_1"]
        \ar[dr, bend right, "f_2"{left}]
        & \B\Orth(r)
        \ar[d, "\incl"]
        \\
        & \B\Orth(r+s)
      \end{tikzcd}
      and that their classifying maps into $\B\Orth$ agree.
    \end{center}
  \item 
    By Whitney's Embedding Theorem % TODO: ref [Adachi, Embeddings and Immersions], Thm 2.2, p.46
    it is known that such embeddings exist.
    Further, by \forexample the General Position theorem
    \cite[Chap.~2]{embeddingsummary}
    it is known that for sufficiently large $k\in\Nat$ all embeddings
    $M\to\R^{n+k}$ are isotopic, \idest homotopic through embeddings,
    and hence all their normal bundles are isomorphic.
    Therefore, the above equivalence relation yields a unique class
    $\N M$ called the \emph{stable normal bundle of $M$}.
    As the classifying maps into $\BO$ agree for all higher
    dimensional normal bundles, this map can serve as classifying map
    for the stable normal bundle.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{LemDef}

\begin{Thm}\label{thm:immersionconj:equivalences}
  Let $n,k\in\Nat$ and $M^n$ be a closed, smooth, $n$-dimensional manifold.
  The following statements are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:1}
    $M$ immerses into $\R^{n+k}$.
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:2}
    There is a vector bundle monomorphism $F\colon\T M\to\T{\R^{n+k}}$.
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:3}
    There is a $k$-dimensional vector bundle
    $\N{}\colon\E{\N{}}\to M$ over $M$ with
    \begin{gather*}
      \N{}\oplus\T M\cong\trivbdl^{n+k}
      \;.
    \end{gather*}
  \item\label{item:immersionconj:4}
    For the map $\N M\colon M\to\B\Orth$ characterising the stable
    normal bundle over $M$ there is a lift $\N{}\colon M\to\B\Orth(k)$
    making the following diagram commute up to homotopy
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        M
        \ar[r, "\N{}"]
        \ar[dr, "\N{M}"{left}, bend right]
        & \BO(k) \ar[d, "\incl", hookrightarrow] \\
        & \BO
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}
From a homotopy theoretical viewpoint, one obviously is most
interested in statement \ref{item:immersionconj:4}.
So, before passing over to the proof, have a look at some first
advantages of this approach.

For one, this formulation points out a certain homotopy invariance of
the immersion problem, namely an $n$-manifold already satisfies the
immersion property if it is \emph{homotopic} to one doing so. 
The interesting intermediate result that every $n$-manifold is
at least \emph{cobordant} to one fulfilling the conjecture's property
will be discussed in \autoref{chap:brown}.

Moreover as a second major advantage, statement
\ref{item:immersionconj:4} directly puts the immersion problem in the
setting of characteristic classes, more precisely Stiefel-Whitney
classes, which provides a formidable further arsenal of tooling.
As an example, the motivation for the exact value of the immersion
dimension will be deduced in \autoref{chap:massey}.

\begin{proof}[proof of \autoref{thm:immersionconj:equivalences}]
  \begin{description}
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:3}$\Leftrightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:4}:]
    Using Steenrod's classification theorem
    \itemref{def:charcls}{item:classificationthm} 
    and the properties of the stable normal bundle of a manifold
    directly yields the equivalence of \ref{item:immersionconj:3} and
    \ref{item:immersionconj:4}.
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:2}$\Leftrightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:3}:]
    In order to get from a vector bundle monomorphism
    $F\colon M\to\R^{n+k}$ to a normal bundle, first note that the
    trivial bundle $\T{\R^{n+k}}$ is easily equipped with an
    orthonormal frame. Thus, one can consider the fibre-wise orthogonal
    complement $\N{}$ of the image $F(\T M)$ which is a vector bundle over
    $F(M)\subset\R^{n+k}$. Its pullback to $M$ along
    $F|_{\zerosec{\T M}}$ obviously fulfils the required property of
    \ref{item:immersionconj:3}.
    
    Conversely, when starting with some rank $k$ vector bundle $\N{}$
    such that $\N{}\oplus\T M\cong\trivbdl^{n+k}$, there is a vector
    bundle monomorphism $\N{}\to\trivbdl$ over $M$. Then the
    following chain of vector bundle morphisms
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        \T M \ar[d]
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & M\times\R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \ar[r]
        & \pt\times \R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & \R^{n+k}\times \R^{n+k} \ar[d,"\trivbdl^{n+k}"]
        \\
        M
        \ar[r,equals]
        & M
        \ar[r]
        & \pt
        \ar[r, hookrightarrow]
        & \R^{n+k}
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is fibre-wise injective in each stage, and hence a monomorphism as
    was needed.
  \item[\ref{item:immersionconj:1}$\Leftrightarrow$\ref{item:immersionconj:2}:]
    The tricky part is to relate \ref{item:immersionconj:1} and
    \ref{item:immersionconj:2}, even though it is easily seen that
    \ref{item:immersionconj:1} implies \ref{item:immersionconj:2} by
    simply taking $F$ to be the differential $\Diff f$ of the
    immersion from \ref{item:immersionconj:1}.
    The converse direction however relies on the following major
    result in immersion theory by Hirsch using preliminary work 
    of Smale
    \cite[Sections~5 and 6]{hirschimmersions}.
    \begin{Thm}[Hirsch-Smale]
      \optcite[Theorem~1.2]{immersionconj} % TODO: better ref for modern formulation
      Let $M$, $N$ be closed manifolds with $\dim M<\dim N$.
      Then the differential map
      $\Diff\colon \Imm M N\to \Mono{\T M}{\T N}$
      induces isomorphisms on the homotopy groups.
      Especially,
      \begin{gather*}
        \Diff_*\colon
        \pi_1(\Imm M N) \overset\sim\longto \pi_1(\Mono{\T M}{\T N})
      \end{gather*}
      describes an isomorphism of path-connected components.
      % Original formulation by Hirsch in [hirschimmersions], sec. 5:
      Therefore, every vector bundle monomorphism
      $F\colon\T M\to\T N$ is homotopic (through vector bundle
      monomorphisms) to a monomorphism which is the differential
      $\Diff f$ of a smooth map $f\colon M\to N$, \idest of an
      immersion.
    \end{Thm}
    Thus, any monomorphism of vector bundles over smooth, closed
    manifolds $M$ and $N$ implies the existence of an immersion from $M$
    to $N$.
    In order to apply this to our problem for some smooth closed
    $n$-manifold $M$ and $\R^{n+k}$ which is not compact, choose
    $N=\Sphere{n+k}$. As $\dim M<n+k$ by assumption, every immersion
    $M\to\Sphere{n+k}$ misses a point on $\Sphere{n+k}$ and hence
    factors over an immersion $M\to\R^{n+k}$.
    This then shows that also \ref{item:immersionconj:2} implies
    \ref{item:immersionconj:1} which makes them equivalent.
