\chapter*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item space means topological space
\item all maps between spaces are continuous
  % \item $\Zmod2 \coloneqq \Z/2\Z$
\item For $X$, $Y$ spaces $[X,Y]$ denotes the set of homotopy classes
  of basepoint preserving maps $X\to Y$.
\item All manifolds are topological manifolds.
\item All homology groups have $\Zmod2$ coefficients if not stated otherwise.
\end{itemize}
