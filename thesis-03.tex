\chapter{Brown's Theorem}
% Review the necessary results about the structure of the unoriented cobor-
% dism ring and explain R. L. Brown’s proof of the immersion conjecture up
% to cobordism. [immersionconj], [brown]
The overall goal of this chapter is to proof the following theorem of
R.~L.~Brown first given in his paper \cite{brown},
which essentially states that the immersion conjecture is true up to
the cobordism relation.
\begin{Thm}[Brown]\label{thm:brown}
  Every closed $n$-manifold is cobordant to an $n$-manifold that immerses
  into $\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}$.
\end{Thm}

As one easily sees that this property is stable under
the ring operations (Lemma~\autoref{lem:brownstableunderringops}),
the main idea and hard part for the proof is to find manifolds
fullfilling the conjecture whose cobordism classes form an
algebraically independent generating set of the cobordism ring. This
requires
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item to know the structure of the cobordism ring
  (\autoref{sec:ringstructure}), in order to see how many
  indecomposable elements are needed in each degree to make up a
  generating set, and
\item a simple criterion when an element of the cobordism ring is
  indecomposable (\autoref{sec:indecomposabilitycriterion}).
\end{enumerate}
When these prerequisites are available, the generating set is
constructed in \autoref{sec:proofbrown}.

For clarity of presentation a couple of results from Thom's paper
\cite{thom} will merely be referenced without proof.

\section{Review: The Cobordism Ring Structure}
\label{sec:ringstructure}
Recall that two closed manifolds of the same dimension $n$ are
(unoriented) cobordant if their disjoint union is the border of an
$(n+1)$-dimensional manifold.
This is an equivalence relation amongst $n$-manifolds, and the
set of equivalence classes forms an abelian group $\c_n$ of order two
with the disjoint sum as addition and the $n$-sphere as zero element.
The cartesian product turns the graded $\Zmod2$-module
$\c_*\coloneqq \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}\c_n$ into an $\Zmod2$-algebra
called the (unoriented) cobordism ring.

Most remarkably, the cobordism relation is homotopy invariant, \idest
homotopic manifolds of the same dimension will be cobordant.
Further, the structure of this algebra is well-known since Thom's
research on this topic \cite{thom}:

\begin{Thm} % TODO: cobordism ring thm
  \optcite[Thm.~1.23]{immersionconj}
  \optcite[Theorem~IV.9]{thom}
  \begin{gather*}
    \c_* \cong \pi_*(\MO)\cong \Zmod2[\sigma_i| i\neq 2^r-1]
  \end{gather*}
  \cite[Theorem~IV.12]{thom}
\end{Thm}


\section{Detecting Indecomposable Elements of the Cobordism Ring}
\label{sec:indecomposabilitycriterion}
In order to find representatives for a set of algebraically
independent generators of the polynomial ring $\c_*$, one needs a way
to detect indecomposable elements. Indecomposable in this 
context means not expressable as a sum of products of lower degree
elements.
This section will follow an approach of Thom 
\cite[Chapters~IV.5 and~IV.6]{thom}.


\subsection{Special Properties of Symmetric Polynomials}
This section examines a special kind of polynomials that
obey a product rule similar to \ref{tag:cartan} whenever evaluated on
elements which have the form of a total Stiefel-Whitney class.
This will make it possible to express certain combinations of
Stiefel-Whitney numbers of product manifolds in terms of ones of their
factors.

From this the subsequent subsection will deduce a simple criterion for
a manifold to be cobordant to a product of manifolds. 

Beforehands, mind the following notation of partitions needed for
symmetrisation of polynomials.
\begin{Def}
  Let $k,l\in\Nat$ be integers.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A partition $\Part=(i_1,\dotsc,i_l)$ of $k$ is an unordered sequence
    of integers such that $k=\sum_{r=0}^{l}i_r$.
    Two partitions only differing by zeros are considered equal.
    In other words, a partition is an equivalence class of sequences in
    $\bigoplus_\infty\Nat$ under the relation $\Part\sim\sigma(\Part)$
    for any permutation $\sigma$.
  \item
    The notation $I^l$ for a sequence of integers will mean a sequence
    of length $l$. Write $I^l\in\Part$ for a sequence of length
    $l$ in the equivalence class of the partition $\Part$. 
  \item
    Denote by $\PartitionsOf{k}$ the set of partitions of $k$.
  \item
    Write $\Emptypart$ for the unique partition of $0$.
  \item The concatenation of sequences and analoguesly partitions will
    be denoted by
    \begin{align*}
      \Nat^{l_1} \times \Nat^{l_2}
      &\xrightarrow{-\concat-}
        \Nat^{l_1+l_2}
      \\
      \PartitionsOf{k_1} \times \PartitionsOf{k_2}
      &\xrightarrow{-\concat-}
        \PartitionsOf{k_1+k_2}
      \\
      (i_1,\dotsc,i_r), (j_1,\dotsc,j_s)
      &\longmapsto
        (i_1,\dotsc,i_r,j_1,\dotsc,j_s)
    \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
\end{Def}

Also as preparation, recall some properties of symmetric polynomials.
\begin{LemDef}
  Let $n\in\Nat$ and $\Zmod2[t_1,\dotsc,t_n]$ be the polynomial ring
  in $n$ variables over the fields $\Zmod2$, each $t_i$ of degree 1.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let
    $\Symm{n}_*
    \coloneqq \Zmod2[t_1,\dotsc,t_n]^{\Permutations{n}}
    \subset \Zmod2[t_1,\dotsc,t_n]$
    be the graded subring of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.
  \item It has a basis indexed by partitions $\Part$ consisting of
    symmetrized monomials, \idest elements of the form
    \begin{gather*}
      \symm{n} t^\Part \coloneqq \sum_{I^n\in\Part} t^I \in \Symm{n}_k
      % TODO: Maybe leave the special notation for symmetrized stuff out?
    \end{gather*}
    where $t^{(i_1,\dotsc,i_n)}\coloneqq t_1^{i_1}\dotsm t_n^{i_n}$.
    \begin{proof}
      Each symmetric polynomial is the sum of homogenous symmetric
      polynomials $\sum_{I^n\in A}t^I$ which can be written as a sum
      of symmetrized monomials by descending induction on the number
      of monomial summands $\#A$.
      Linear independence is clear as monomials $t^I$ and $t^{I'}$ are
      linearly independent if $I\neq I'$, and any two partitions have
      empty intersection.
      \optcite[footnote~2, p.~154]{thom}
    \end{proof}
  \item $\Symm{n}_*$ is generated by the algebraically independent
    elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables
    \begin{gather*}
      \el i n\coloneqq \symm{n} t^{\Part_i}
      \in \Symm{n}_i
      \qquad \text{for }
      \Part_i = (1,\dotsc,1)
      \in \PartitionsOf i
    \end{gather*}
    for $1\leq i\leq n$.
    \Forexample
    $\el 1 n=\sum_{r=1}^{n}t_r$,
    $\el 2 n=\sum_{1\leq r<s\leq n} t_r t_s$.
    \begin{proof}
      % TODO: ref
      This is the fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials
      \cite[Chapter~4.4, Satz~1]{bosch2013algebra}.
    \end{proof}
  \item As a simple calculation shows, the elementary symmetric
    polynomials in $n$ variables fulfill
    \begin{gather}\label{eq:sumelemsymmpoly}
      1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \el i n
      = \prod_{r=1}^{n}(1+t_n)
    \end{gather}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{LemDef}

Now the desired polynomials can be defined.
\begin{Def}
  \optcite[p.~90]{milnorlectures}
  Let $k\in\Nat$, $\Part\in\PartitionsOf k$, and let
  $\Zmod2[\alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_k]$ be the polynomial ring in $k$
  variables where $\alpha_i$ has degree $i$.
  Define the homogenous polynomial
  $\s{\Part}\in\Zmod2[\alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_k]$ of degree $k$ by
  \begin{gather*}
    \s{\Part}(\el 1 n,\dotsc, \el k n) = \symm{n} t^{\Part} \in \Symm{n}_k
  \end{gather*}
  for some $n\geq k$. Mind, that this is well-defined as the
  elementary symmetric polynomials are algebraically independent, and
  the definition does not depend on $n$ as long as $k\leq n$.
  
  For a any graded ring $A_*=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} A_i$ write elements as
  $a=\sum_i a_i \coloneqq (a_0,a_1,\dotsc)$.
  For such an element define the evaluation of $\s{\Part}$ as
  \begin{gather*}
    \s{\Part}(a) \coloneqq \s{\Part}(a_1,\dotsc,a_k)
    \;,
  \end{gather*}
  \idest skip $a_0$ and all higher $a_i$.
\end{Def}
\begin{Ex}
  The first such polynomials over $\Zmod2$ are
  \begin{align*}
    k&=0:
    &\s{\Emptypart} &= 1
    \\ k&=1:
    &\s{(1)} &= \alpha_1
    \\ k&=2:
    &\s{(2)} &= \alpha_1^2
        &\s{(1,1)} &= \alpha_2
    \\ k&=3:
    &\s{(3)} &= \alpha_1^3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3
        &\s{(1,2)} &= \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3
             &\s{(1,1,1)} &= \alpha_3
  \end{align*}
  \cite[p.~90]{milnorlectures}
\end{Ex}

These polynomials that translate the basis $\symm{n}t^{\Part}$ of
$\Symm{n}_k$ into expressions of the generators $\el i n$
fulfill as promised the following interesting property concerning
multiplication of elements.
\begin{Lem}\label{lem:productrule:general}
  \optcite[Theorem~33, p.~91f]{milnorlectures}
  Let $k\in\Nat$, and let $A_*=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} A_i$ be a graded ring.
  For $a,b\in A_*$ with $a_0=1=b_0$, and any partition
  $\Part\in\PartitionsOf k$ holds
  \begin{gather*}
    \s{\Part}(a\cdot b)
    = \sum_{\Part_1\concat\Part_2=\Part}
    \s{\Part_1}(a) \cdot \s{\Part_2}(b)
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
  \begin{proof}
    As for the definition of $\s{\Part}$ it suffices to check equality
    on algebraically independent elements. So, make the following choices:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The result will be independent of $n$, as long as
      $n$ is large enough, thus choose $n=2k$.
      Note that this is the smallest choice for $n$ for which there
      may be a pair of sequences $J_1^k\concat J_2^k\in\Part$
      where one is all zeros.
    \item For simplicity of notation write
      $x_i=t_i$ and $y_i=t_{2i}$ for $1\leq i\leq k$ to split the
      variables $(t_1,\dotsc,t_{2k})$ into two equal parts.
    \item In order to directly work with the definition of $\s{\Part}$ it is
      convenient to choose as algebraically independent elements
      \begin{align*}
        a &\coloneqq
            \prod_{\mathclap{r=1}}^k(1+t_r)
            \cequalsby{\eqref{eq:sumelemsymmpoly}}
            1 + \sum_{i=1}^k \el i k(x_1,\dotsc,x_k)
            \;\text{, and}\\
        b &\coloneqq
            \prod_{\mathclap{r=k+1}}^n(1+t_r)
            \cequalsby{\eqref{eq:sumelemsymmpoly}}
            1 + \sum_{i=1}^k \el i k(y_1,\dotsc,y_k)
            \;\text{, then}\\
        a\cdot b
          &=
            \prod_{r=1}^n (1+t_r)
            \cequalsby{\eqref{eq:sumelemsymmpoly}}
            1 + \sum_{i=1}^n \el i n (t_1,\dotsc,t_n)
            \;.
      \end{align*}
      Consequently, the sets 
      $(a_1,\dotsc,a_k)$, $(b_1,\dotsc,b_k)$, and
      $(a\cdot b)_{1\leq i\leq n}$ are algebraically independent, as
      was needed.
    \end{itemize}
    Now calculate
    \begin{align*}
      \s{\Part}(a\cdot b)
      &\coloneqq
        \symm{n} t^{\Part}
      \\ &\equalsby{Def.}
           \sum_{I^n\in\Part}
           t_1^{i_1}\dotsm t_n^{i_n}
      \\ &=
           \sum_{I^n\in\Part}
           x^{(i_1,\dotsc,i_k)}\cdot y^{(i_{k+1},\dotsc,i_n)}
      \\ &=
           \sum_{J_1^k\concat J_2^k\in\Part}
           x^{J_1} \cdot y^{J_2}
      \\ &\equalsby{Group by equiv.}
           \sum_{\Part_1\concat \Part_2=\Part}
           \sum_{\substack{J_1^k\in\Part_1\\ J_2^k\in\Part_2}}
      x^{J_1} \cdot y^{J_2}
      \\ &=
           \sum_{\Part_1\concat \Part_2=\Part}
           \left(\sum_{J_1^k\in\Part_1} x^{J_1}\right)

           \left(\symm{k} y^{\Part_2}\right)
      \\ &\equalsby{Def.}
           \sum_{\Part_1\concat \Part_2=\Part}
           \s{\Part_1}\left( \el 1 k(x_1,\dotsc,x_k),\dotsc \right)
           \cdot
           \s{\Part_2}\left( \el 1 k(y_1,\dotsc,y_k),\dotsc \right)

           \s{\Part_1}(a) \cdot \s{\Part_2}(b)
           \qedhere
    \end{align*}
  \end{proof}
\end{Lem}

\begin{Ex}
  The most important partition of an integer $k$ will be the trivial
  one $(k)\in\PartitionsOf k$. In this case
  Lemma~\autoref{lem:productrule:general} says
  \begin{gather*}
    \s{(k)}(a\cdot b) = \s{(k)}(a) + \s{(k)}(b)
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
\end{Ex}


\subsection{Stiefel-Whitney Numbers of Product Manifolds}
In order to apply the special polynomials from the preceeding section
and their product property \autoref{lem:productrule:general} to
the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of (product) manifolds, first start with application
to Stiefel-Whitney classes.

So, let $M^n=M_1^{n_1}\times M_2^{n_2}$ all be closed manifolds of the
noted dimension throughout the section.

Recall that
\begin{enumerate}
\item the cohomology ring $\H^*(M)$ of a space respectively
  manifold is a graded ring,
\item the total Stiefel-Whitney number of a manifold is of the form
  $\W{M_i} = 1 + \w 1 {M_i} + \dotsb + \w n {M_i}$, and that
\item by Künneth holds
  \begin{align*}
    \H^*(M_1)\otimes \H^*(M_2)
    &\overset{\cong}\longto \H^*(M)
    \\
    c_1 \otimes c_2
    &\longmapsto c_1\cdot c_2
      \coloneqq \pb\proj_1 c_1 \cdot \pb\proj_2 c_2
  \end{align*}
  and $\W{M} = \W{M_1} \cdot \W{M_2}$ by
  \ref{tag:swclassesmultiplicativity} of the Stiefel-Whitney classes.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, one can apply the multiplication
Lemma~\autoref{lem:productrule:general} to $\W{M}$, which immediately
yields:
\begin{Cor}\label{cor:productrule:swcl}
  For $M=M_1\times M_2$ manifolds as above one gets for any partition
  $\Part\in\PartitionsOf n$:
  \begin{align*}
    \s{\Part}(\W{M})
    =
    \s{\Part}\left(\W{M_1}\cdot \W{M_2}\right)
    &\cequalsby{\autoref{lem:productrule:general}}
      \sum_{\mathclap{\Part_1\concat\Part_2=\Part}}
      \s{\Part_1}(\W{M_1}) \cdot \s{\Part_2}(\W{M_2})
    \\ &=
         \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{
         \Part_1\concat\Part_2=\Part\\
    \Part_1\in\PartitionsOf{n_1}\\
    \Part_2\in\PartitionsOf{n_2}\\
    }}}
    \s{\Part_1}(\W{M_1}) \cdot \s{\Part_2}(\W{M_2})
  \end{align*}
  \begin{proof}
    The last equality is due to the following dimension reasons.
    For any any manifold $W$ and a partition $\Part$ of $k$,
    $\s{\Part}(\W{W})$ is of degree $k$ if $k\leq\dim W$ and zero else.
    Therefore, for any combination of partitions
    $\Part_1\in\PartitionsOf{k_1}$,
    $\Part_2\in\PartitionsOf{k_2}$
    where $k_1+k_2=n=n_1+n_2$ with $k_i\neq n_i$, the product
    $\s{\Part_1}(\W{M_1})\cdot\s{\Part_2}(\W{M_2})$ will have a zero
    factor and can be skipped.
  \end{proof}
\end{Cor}

In order to pass to Stiefel-Whitney numbers instead of classes, use
the following notation.
\begin{Def}
  Let $W$ be a closed manifold and $\Part\in\PartitionsOf{\dim W}$.
  Then write
  \begin{align*}
    \s{\Part}(W) &\coloneqq \s{\Part}(\W{W})\\
    \snum{\Part}{W} &\coloneqq \capped{\s{\Part}(W)}{\fundcl{W}}
    \;.
  \end{align*}
\end{Def}

Now the product rule \autoref{lem:productrule:general} translates to
\begin{Cor}
  For closed manifolds $M_1$, and $M_2$ with dimensions $n_1$ and
  $n_2$ one has
  \begin{align*}
    \snum{\Part}{M_1\times M_2}
    &= \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{
      \Part_1\concat\Part_2=\Part\\
    \Part_1\in\PartitionsOf{n_1}\\
    \Part_2\in\PartitionsOf{n_2}\\
    }}}
    \snum{\Part_1}{M_1} \cdot \snum{\Part_2}{M_2}
    \quad \in \quad \Zmod2
  \end{align*}
  and as a special case
  \begin{align}
    % \notag
    % \snum{(n_1,n_2)}{M_1\times M_2}
    % &= \snum{(n_1)}{M_1} \cdot \snum{(n_2)}{M_2}
    % \\
    \label{eq:productrule:swnum}
    \snum{(n_1+n_2)}{M_1\times M_2} &= 0
                                      \;.
  \end{align}
  In particular, if $\snum{(\dim W)}{W}\neq 0$ for a closed manifold
  $W$, then $W$ is no product manifold.
  \begin{proof}
    The statement immediately follows from the previous
    Corollary~\autoref{cor:productrule:swcl} with the following
    two facts:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The generator $\fundcl{M_1\times
        M_2}\in\H^{n_1+n_2}(M_1\times M_2)$ corresponds to the generator
      $\fundcl{M_1}\otimes\fundcl{M_2}\in
      \H^{n_1}(M_1)\otimes\H^{n_2}(M_2)\cong \H^{n_1+n_2}(M_1\times M_2)$
      under the Künneth isomorphism.
    \item For cohomology classes $c_1\in\H^{n_1}(M_1)$, $c_2\in\H^{n_2}(M_2)$ holds
      \begin{gather*}
        \capped{c_1\otimes c_2}{\fundcl{M_1\times M_2}}
        = \capped{c_1\otimes c_2}{\fundcl{M_1}\otimes\fundcl{M_2}}
        = \capped{c_1}{\fundcl{M_1}} \cdot \capped{c_2}{\fundcl{M_2}}
        \in \Zmod2
      \end{gather*}
      by the universal property of the tensor product.
      \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}    
  \end{proof}
\end{Cor}

\autoref{eq:productrule:swnum} is the desired obstruction for
a manifold to be a product or---as will be explained in the next
subsection---to be cobordant to a product.
Finally, this statement will be an invaluable tool for detecting
manifolds that are not only not cobordant to a product manifold but
whose cobordism class is indecomposable.


\subsection{A Criterion for Indecomposability}
The ultimate goal of this subsection is to deduce the following
theorem which is a consequence of Thom's proof of the multiplicative
structure of the cobordism ring (see \cite[Section~IV.5]{thom}).
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:indecomposabilitycriterion}
  A closed $n$-manifold $M$ represents an indecomposable element of
  the cobordism ring $\c_*$, if and only if
  \begin{gather*}
    \snum{(n)}{M} \neq 0 \in \Zmod2
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
  % for non-dyadic decomposition: \optcite[p.~156]{thom};
  % for summation notation: \optcite[p.154, (4)f]{thom};
\end{Thm}

For the mentioned proof, which includes the above statement, Thom
constructs special manifolds that form a basis of the cobordism ring,
and are uniquely characterized by the below properties.
For the formulation call a sequence or partition \emph{non-dyadic}, if
none of its entries is of the form $2^m-1$. 
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:basiscobordismring} % TODO: Proof
  There exists a basis of the cobordism ring represented by manifolds
  $V_\Part$ that is in each degree $k$ indexed by non-dyadic
  partitions $\Part$ of $k$. Further, the $V_\Part$ are uniquely
  characterized by
  \begin{gather*}
    \s{\Part'}(\W{V_\Part}) = \delta_{\Part,\Part'}
    \in \H^k(V_{\Part})\cong \Zmod2
  \end{gather*}
  for any non-dyadic partitions $\Part,\Part'\in\PartitionsOf{k}$,
  where $\delta$ is the usual Kronecker delta
  \cite[Section~IV.5, p.~194ff]{thom}.
  \begin{proof}
    % TODO: proof/construction special basis cobordism ring [Thom]; [Milnor] better source?
  \end{proof}
\end{Thm}

Before starting with the proof of the desired result one needs the
following connection between Stiefel-Whitney classes of a manifold and
its cobordism class. Thom rather directly deduces this from the
existence of the above basis.
\begin{Thm}[Thom]\label{thm:cobordantiffswnumscoincide}
  Two closed manifolds are cobordant if and only if all of their
  Stiefel-Whitney numbers coincide.
  \begin{proof}[proof (sketch)]
    The proof that manifolds with coinciding Stiefel-Whitney numbers
    are cobordant was conducted by Thom \cite[Theorem IV.10]{thom}.
    To see that cobordant manifolds have the same Stiefel-Whitney

    $V_{\Part_1}\times V_{\Part_2}$ is cobordant to

    = \delta_{\Part', \Part_1\concat\Part_2}$
    by \ref{cor:productrule:swcl}, and thus all their Stiefel-Whitney

  \item\label{item:generatorscobordimsring}
    By conclusion \ref{item:manifoldbasisrepr},
    the basis elements represented by a $k$-dimensional manifold

    generators of the cobordism ring.
  \item By conclusion \ref{item:generatorscobordimsring}, the bordism
    class of a manifold $W$ of dimension $k$ is an indecomposable
    element of $\c_*$ if and only if its representation by basis
    elements $[V_\Part]$ contains the unique $k$-dimensional
    indecomposable basis element $[V_{(k)}]$ as summand,
    \idest if and only if $\snum{(k)}{W}\neq 0$.

\section
{Proof of Brown's Theorem: Finding a Convenient Generating Set}
\label{sec:proofbrown}
Remember that the goal of this chapter was to prove R.~L.~Brown's
theorem \ref{thm:brown} which states that the immersion conjecture is
true up to cobordism.

If one can show that the conjecture's statement is stable
under the ring operations of the cobordism ring, it will suffice to
find a generating set of $\c_*$ which fulfills the conjecture.
The latter will heavily rely on the indecomposability criterion found
in \autoref{thm:indecomposabilitycriterion} and the structure of the
cobordism ring.

The stability properties needed are the following.
\begin{Lem}\label{lem:brownstableunderringops}
  Let $M_i^{n_i}$ be a closed manifold immersing into
  $\R^{2n_i-\alpha(n_i)}$ for $i=1,2$.
  Then both manifolds
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $M_1\disjointsum M_2$ for $n_1=n_2=n$, and
  \item $M_1\times M_2$ for $n_1$, $n_2$ arbitrary
  \end{enumerate}
  immerse into $\R^{2(n_1+n_2)-\alpha(n_1+n_2)}$.
  \begin{proof}
    $M_1\times M_2$ immerses into the real space of dimension
    \begin{align*}
      \left( 2n_1-\alpha(n_1) \right)
      + \left( 2n_2-\alpha(n_2) \right)
      &= 2(n_1+n_2) - \left(\alpha(n_1)+\alpha(n_2)\right)\\
      &\leq 2(n_1+n_2) - \left(\alpha(n_1 + n_2)\right)
    \end{align*}
    where the inequality is due to the number theoretic fact
    $\alpha(n_1+n_2) \leq \alpha(n_1)+\alpha(n_2)$.

    For $n_1=n=n_2$ the images of the immersions
    \begin{gather*}
      \iota_1\colon M_1\to\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}
      \qquad \text{and} \qquad
      \iota_2\colon M_2\to\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}
    \end{gather*}
    are compact. So by
    concatenation with translation they can be assumed to be disjoint,
    wherefore the disjoint union
    $\iota_1\disjointsum\iota_2\colon M_1\disjointsum M_2\to\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}$
    is again an immersion.
  \end{proof}
\end{Lem}

Thus, for the proof of Brown's theorem only a generating set of $\c_*$
is needed each member of which fulfills the immersion conjecture.

\subsection{Twisted Products}
The candidates for a generating set will be inductively constructed
using the so-called twisted product construction explained below.
The main advantage of this tool is---besides quite a couple of handy
preservation properties---the fact that a twisted product is
indecomposable if and only if its factor is and the dimension was
chosen correctly. The latter will be the main result of this section.

\begin{Def}
  \optcite[p.~83]{immersionconj}
  \optcite[compare §4, Def.~of~$P(m;X)$]{brown}
  Let $X$ be a space and $k\in\Nat$ an integer.
  Define the \emph{twisted product of $X$ by $\Sphere k$}, denoted
  $\Twistedprod{k}{X}$, to be the orbit space of the properly
  discontinuous $\Zmod2$-action on $\Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}$ given
  by
  \begin{align*}
    \Zmod2 &\leftgroupaction \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}
             \;,
    &[1] \actson (s, (p_1,p_2)) &\coloneqq (-s, (p_2, p_1))
                                \;,
  \end{align*}
  which combines the antipodal action $[1]\actson s\coloneqq -s$ on
  $\Sphere k$ and twisting on $X\times X$.
  For a map $f\colon X\to Y$ of spaces, define
  \begin{gather*}
    \Twistedprod{k}{f}\coloneqq \Id\times f\times f/\sim \colon
    \Twistedprod{k}{X}\longto\Twistedprod{k}{Y}
    \;,\quad
    [s,(p_1,p_2)] \longmapsto [s,(f(p_1),f(p_2))]
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
\end{Def}
\begin{Ex}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\Twistedprod k {\pt} = \RP k$
  \item $\Twistedprod 0 {M} = M\times M$
  \end{itemize}
\end{Ex}

First, gather some rather immediate, convenient properties. It is
especially noteworthy how well the twisted product behaves concerning
manifolds and fibre bundles.
\begin{Rem}\label{rem:twistedprodproperties}
  Let $X$ be a space and $k\in\Nat$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Twistedprod{-}{k}$ is a functor on the category of
    topological spaces preserving injectivity.
  \item\label{item:twistedprodfibrebdl}
    $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ preserves fibre bundles,
    \idest for a fibre bundle $\xi\colon\E\xi\to X$ with fibre $F$
    the twisted product $\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}\colon
    \Twistedprod{k}{\E\xi}\to \Twistedprod{k}{X}$
    is again a fibre bundle with fibre $F\times F$.
    This comes from the fibre bundle
    \begin{gather*}
      F\times F
      \longto \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{\E\xi}
      \longto \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}
    \end{gather*}
    where all maps are maps of $\Zmod2$-sets.
    As a special case, $\Twistedprod{k}{X}$ admits a fibre bundle
    \begin{gather}\label{eq:twistedprodrpnfibrebdl}
      X\times X
      \longto \Twistedprod{k}{X}
      \longto \RP k = \Sphere k/\sim
    \end{gather}
    with fibre $X\times X$ which comes from the trivial fibre bundle
    $X\to\pt$.
    Further, let $\eta\colon\E\eta\to X$ be
    another fibre bundle, and $f\colon X'\to X$ a map.
    One has:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ respects sums of fibre bundles, \idest
      \begin{gather*}
        \Twistedprod{k}{\xi\oplus\eta\colon \E\xi\oplus\E\eta\to X}
        = \Twistedprod{k}{\xi}\oplus\Twistedprod{k}{\eta}
      \end{gather*}
    \item\label{item:twistedprod:preservespb}
      $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ respects pullbacks, \idest
      \begin{gather*}
        \Twistedprod{k}{\pb f \xi}
        = \pb{\left(\Twistedprod{k}{f}\right)}
        \left(\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}\right)
      \end{gather*}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:twistedprodmanifold}
    $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ preserves closed smooth manifolds, \idest
    for a closed smooth manifold $M^n$, $\Twistedprod{k}{M}$ is a
    again a $(2m+k)$-dimensional closed smooth manifold.
    This is because the proper discontinuity comes from the antipodal
    $\Zmod2$-action, and makes the projection
    \begin{gather*}
      \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}
      \xrightarrow{\pi}
      \Twistedprod{k}{X}
      \coloneqq
      \left( \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X} \right)/\sim
    \end{gather*}
    a two-leaved covering space.
    Further:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{item:twistedprodpreservesimmersions}
      $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ preserves immersions.
    \item\label{item:twistedprod:tangentspace}
      $\T\Twistedprod{k}{M}
      \cong \pb\proj\T{\RP k} \oplus \Twistedprod{k}{\T M}$,
      \idest the tangent space of $\Twistedprod{k}{M}$ can be obtained
      from $\Twistedprod{k}{\T M}$ by adding the missing tangent space
      part of the sphere:
      \begin{alignat*}{4}
        \T{\Twistedprod{k}{M}}
        &\cong& \T{\left(\Twistedprodcovspace{k}{M}\right)}/\sim \\
        &\cong& \T \Sphere k\times \T M\times\T M/\sim
        &\overset{\cong}{\longto}
        \pb\proj \T{\RP k} \oplus \Twistedprod{k}{\T M}
        \\
        &&[(s,v), (m_1,v_1), (m_2,v_2)]
        &\longmapsto
          \left( ([s], v), [s, (m_1,v_1), (m_2, v_2)] \right)
      \end{alignat*}
      where $\proj\colon\Twistedprod{k}{M}\to\RP k$ is the projection.
      The first isomorphism is due to the covering space property, and
      the last is easily seen to be a well-defined isomorphism of
      vector bundles.
      Further note that for a map of manifolds $f\colon M\to N$,
      the differential map $\mathrm{D}\Twistedprod{k}{f}$ on tangent spaces
      will be the identity on the first summand.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Rem}

Besides the above direct properties, there is a fairly easy
description of the cohomology ring of a twisted product relating it to
the cohomology ring of its factor.
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:twistedprod:cohomstructure}
  \optcite[Thm~7.1, p.~1111]{brown}
  Let $X$ be a space and $k\in\Nat$.
  Define
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    $N\coloneqq
    \left\{
        a\otimes b + b\otimes a
        \in \H^*(X\times X)\cong \H^*(X)\otimes\H^*(X)
      \right\}$,
  \item
    $d\colon \H^*(X)\to\H^*(X\times X)$,
    $d(a)\coloneqq a\times a$, and
    $D\coloneqq
    \left\{ d(a)=a\otimes a \in \H^*(X\times X) \right\}$,
  \item
    $s\in\H^k(\Sphere k)\cong\Zmod2$ to be the generator, and
  \item
    $c\coloneqq \pb\proj x$ to be the pullback of the generator
    $x\in\H^*(\RP k)\cong\Zmod2[x]$.
  \end{itemize}
  Note that $N+D$ is closed under multiplication and addition.
  Then the cohomology ring of $\Twistedprod{k}{X}$ has the form
  \begin{gather*}
    \H^*(\Twistedprod{k}{X})
    \cong
    \left(\H^*(\RP k)\otimes D\right)
    + \left( 1\otimes N \right)
    + \left( \H^m(\Sphere m) \otimes N \right)
  \end{gather*}
  with the induced grading and multiplication which respects the
  relation $c\otimes N=0$.
  For readability skip $1\otimes$ and $\otimes d(1)$ in element
  notation wherever it is clear to which part the summand belongs.
  Further it fulfills
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    For $\pi\colon \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}\to\Twistedprod{k}{X}$
    holds
    \begin{align}\label{eq:twistedprodcohom:pi}
      \pb\pi(c)&=0
      &\text{and}&
      &\pb\pi(c^r\otimes d(a_1) + 1\otimes n_1 + s\otimes n_2)
      &= 1\otimes n_1 + s\otimes n_2
        \;.
    \end{align}
  \item
    For any section $s_p\colon\RP k\to\Twistedprod{k}{X}$, $q\mapsto[q,p,p]$,
    of the fibre bundle described in
    \eqref{eq:twistedprodrpnfibrebdl}, and $n_1,n_2\in N$, $a\in\H^*(X)$ holds
    \begin{align}\label{eq:twistedprodcohom:section}
      \pb s_p(c^r\otimes d(a)) &= \delta_{a,1} \cdot x^r
      &\text{and}&
      &\pb s_p(1\otimes n_1 + s\otimes n_2) &= 0
      \;.
    \end{align}
    where $\delta_{a,1}$ is the Kronecker delta.
  \item\label{item:twistedprod:preservescohominj}
    $\Twistedprod{k}{-}$ preserves injectivity on cohomology.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}

This then immediately gives a result on the Stiefel-Whitney classes of
a twisted product of line bundles that will be used below to simplify
calculations involving higher dimensional bundles.
\begin{Cor}\label{cor:twistedprod:swlinebdl}
  \optcite[Prop.~7.4, p.~1113]{brown}
  Let $\xi\colon E\to X$ be a line bundle with total Stiefel-Whitney
  class $\W{\xi}=1+\alpha$.
  Define $e\colon\H^*(X)\to N\subset\H^*(X\times X)$,
  $e(a)\coloneqq 1\otimes a+a\otimes 1$.
  Then
  \begin{gather*}
    \W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}} = 1+ (c\otimes d(1)+1\otimes
    e(\alpha)) + 1\otimes d(\alpha)
    = 1+c+e(\alpha)+d(\alpha)
    \;,
  \end{gather*}
  respectively $\w1\xi = c+e(\alpha)$, $\w2\xi=d(\alpha)$.
  \begin{proof}
    For $k=0$ this is simply the product rule for the total
    Stiefel-Whitney class because $\Twistedprod{0}{\xi}=\xi\times\xi$
    and $c=0$. Thus, assume $k\geq0$.
    Then by \autoref{thm:twistedprod:cohomstructure} the total
    Stiefel-Whitney class of the two-dimensional vector bundle
    $\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}$ must be of the general form
    \begin{align*}
      \W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}}
      &=
        1 &\quad&&&{(=\ws0)} \\
      &+ \delta_1\cdot c\otimes d(1) + \delta_2\cdot c^2\otimes d(1)
          &&\delta_1,\delta_2\in\{0,1\}
            &&{(\text{check section})}\\
      &+ 1\otimes d(a)
          &&a \neq 1
                &&{(\text{check $\pi$})} \\
      &+ {\textstyle \sum_{r\in I} c^{i_r}\otimes d(a_r)}
          &&a_r\neq 1,\; i_r>1
            &&{(=0\text{ by dim.})} \\
      &+ 1\otimes n_1 + s\otimes n_2
          &&n_2, 1\neq n_1\in N
                &&{(\text{check $\pi$})}
    \end{align*}
    The index set $I$ must be empty as any $c^{i_r}\otimes d(a_r)$
    would have dimension greater two.
    So, it remains to check the pullbacks of $\W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}}$
    along a section $s_p\colon\RP k\to\Twistedprod{k}{X}$ and along
    the projection
    $\pi\colon\Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}\to\Twistedprod{k}{X}$
    in order to identify the other summands.
    \begin{description}
    \item[$\pb\pi\W{\Twistedprod k \xi}$:]
      $\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}$ is the quotient of the bundle
      $\trivbdl\times\xi\times\xi\colon
      \Twistedprodcovspace{k}{E}\to\Twistedprodcovspace{k}{X}$, where
      \begin{gather*}
        \W{\Id\times\xi\times\xi}
        = 1\cdot \W{\xi}\cdot\W{\xi}
        = 1 + 1\otimes e(\alpha) + 1\otimes d(\alpha)
        \;.
      \end{gather*}
      As $\pi$ is a covering map,
      % TODO: nicify reasoning?
      $\pb\pi\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}=\trivbdl\times\xi\times\xi$,
      and thus
      $\pb\pi\W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}}=\W{\Id\times\xi\times\xi}$.
      By \eqref{eq:twistedprodcohom:pi} $\pb\pi$ is the identity on
      elements of this form, this must be a summand of
      $\W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}}$.
    \item[$\pb s_p \W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}}$:]
        The pullback of $\Twistedprod{k}{\xi}$ along this section is
        \begin{gather*}
          \Twistedprod{k}{E_p}=\Twistedprod{k}{\R}\to \RP k
          \;,\quad
          [s, v_1,v_2] \mapsto [s]
          \;.
        \end{gather*}
        In order to simplify this, use the well-defined vector bundle
        isomorphism
        \optcite[Prop.~4.3,p~1107]{brown}
        \begin{align*}
          \Twistedprod{k}{\R}
          &\longto
            (\Twistedprodcovspace{k}{\R}/\approx)
            \cong \E{(\gamma\oplus\trivbdl)} \\
          [s, v_1, v_2]
          &\longmapsto
            [s, v_1+v_2, v_1-v_2]
        \end{align*}
        where $\approx$ is the equivalence relation identifying
        $(s,v_1,v_2)$ and $(-s,-v_1,v_2)$, and
        $\gamma$ is the tautological line bundle for $\RP k$.
        % TODO: Give a fitting description of the tautological line bdl somewhere
        Then $\pb{s_p}\Twistedprod{k}{\xi} \cong
        \gamma\oplus\trivbdl$ and $\pb{s_p}\W{\xi} =
        \W{\gamma\oplus\trivbdl} = 1+x$ completing the proof.
      \end{description}
    \end{proof}
\end{Cor}

Now that the cohomology ring of a twisted product is well-known, one
can investigate the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of twisted product manifolds.
As promised, the following result will be the cornerstone when inductively
defining the desired basis for the cobordism ring in the subsequent section.
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:twistedprod:indecompcriterion}
  Let $M^n$ be a manifold and $k\in\Nat_{\geq1}$.
  then $\Twistedprod{k}{M}$ represents an indecomposable class of the
  cobordism ring if and only if $M$ does and $\binom{k+n-1}{n}$ is
  non-zero modulo two.
\end{Thm}
Using Theorem~\autoref{thm:indecomposabilitycriterion}, saying
a manifold $M^n$ represents an indecomposable element if and only if
$\snum{(n)}{M}$ is non-zero,
Theorem~\autoref{thm:twistedprod:indecompcriterion} is a direct
consequence of the following Lemma.
\begin{Lem}\label{lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion}
  Let $M$, $n$, $k$ be as in
  \autoref{thm:twistedprod:indecompcriterion} above.
  Then there is a map $f\colon X\to M$ of spaces which is injective on
  cohomology and fulfills
  \begin{gather*}
    \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}} \s{(2n+k)}(\Twistedprod{k}{M})
    = \binom{k+n-1}{n} \cdot c^k
    \cdot d\left( \pb f \s{(n)}(M) \right)
    \in \H^{2n+k}(\Twistedprod{k}{M})
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
\end{Lem}
\begin{proof}[proof of \autoref{lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion}]
  As the Stiefel-Whitney classes of twisted products of line bundles
  are well-known, take $f$ to be a reduction of $\T M$ to line bundles
  using the splitting principle.
  \Idest choose a space $X$ and a map $f\colon X\to M$ which is
  injective on cohomology and fulfills
  $\pb f \T M = \xi_1\oplus\dotsb\oplus\xi_n$ for line bundles
  $\xi_i$ over $X$, each with total Stiefel-Whitney class
  $\W{\xi_i}=1+\alpha_i$.
  With the fibre bundle properties from
  \itemref{rem:twistedprodproperties}{item:twistedprodfibrebdl}%
  \ref{item:twistedprod:preservespb}
  and the tangent space structure from
  \itemref{rem:twistedprodproperties}{item:twistedprodmanifold}%
  \ref{item:twistedprod:tangentspace}
  this yields on vector bundles:
  \begin{align*}
    \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}} \Twistedprod{k}{\T M}
    &\cequalsby{\autoref{rem:twistedprodproperties}}
      \Twistedprod{k}{\pb f \T M}
      = \Twistedprod{k}{\bigoplus_{i\leq n}\xi_i}

    \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}} \W{\Twistedprod{k}{\T M}}
    &= \prod_{i\leq n} \W{\Twistedprod{k}{\xi_i}}
      \cequalsby{\autoref{cor:twistedprod:swlinebdl}}
      \prod_{i\leq n} \left(1 + c + e(\alpha_i) + d(\alpha_i)\right)
    \\
    \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}} \W{\T\Twistedprod{k}{M}}

    &= (c+1)^{k+1}
      \cdot \prod_{i\leq n} \left(1+c+e(\alpha_i)+d(\alpha_i)\right)
  \end{align*}
  In order to work with these Stiefel-Whitney class expressions as
  symmetric polynomials, introduce variables $u_i, v_i$ of degree
  one such that
  \begin{align*}
    \w1{\xi_i} &= c+e(\alpha_i) = \el 1 2(u_i, v_i) = u_i+v_i \\
    \w2{\xi_i} &= d(\alpha_i)   = \el 2 2(u_i, v_i) = u_iv_i \\
    \W{\xi_i}  &= 1+c+e(\alpha_i)+d(\alpha_i)
                 = 1+\sum_{i\leq2}\el i 2(u_i,v_i) = (1+u_i)(1+v_i)
                 \;.
  \end{align*}
  The key point now qualifying $f$ for the proof, is that both $f$ and
  thus by
  \itemref{thm:twistedprod:cohomstructure}{item:twistedprod:preservescohominj}
  also $\Twistedprod{k}{f}$ are injective on cohomology, and fulfill
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item with $\W{\pb f\T M} = \prod_{i=1}^n (1+\alpha_i)$
    \begin{gather}\label{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:sM}
      \pb f \s{(n)}(M)
      = \s{(n)}(\W{\pb f\T M})
      = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^n
      \;
    \end{gather}
  \item and with
    $\W{\pb f\T{\Twistedprod{k}{M}}}
    = \prod_{i=1}^{m+1}(1+c) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^n
    (1+u_i)(1+v_i)$
    that
    \begin{align}\notag
      \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}} \s{(2n+k)}(\Twistedprod{k}{M})
      &= \s{(2n+k)}(\W{\pb f\T{\Twistedprod{k}{M}}}) \\
      \label{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:sDkM}
      &= (k+1)c^{2n+k} + \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i^{2n+k} + v_i^{2n+k})
        \;.
    \end{align}
  \end{enumerate}
  In order to formulate
  $\pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}}\s{(2n+k)}(\Twistedprod{k}{M})$ 
  in terms of $c$ and $d(\alpha_i)$,
  use one of the Newton-Girard formulas % TODO: ref
  saying:
  \begin{Lem}[Newton-Girard]
    For integers $l, m\in\Nat$ holds
    \begin{align*}
      \symm{l} t^m
      &= \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2+\dotsb+mr_=m}}
        (-1)^m \frac{m\cdot(r_1+\dotsb+r_m-1)!}{(r_1)!\dotsm(r_m)!}
        \cdot \prod_{i=1}^m (-\el i l)^{r_i}
        \;.
    \end{align*}
    As a special case for $l=2$ this becomes modulo 2
    \begin{align*}
      t_1^m + t_2^m
      &= \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=m}}
        \frac{m\cdot(r_1+r_2-1)!}{(r_1)!(r_2)!}
        \cdot (\el 1 2)^{r_1} \cdot (\el 2 2)^{r_2}
      = \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=m}}
        \altbinom{r_1-1}{r_2} (t_1+t_2)^{r_1}(t_1t_2)^{r_2}
    \end{align*}
    where $\frac{(r_1+2r_2)(r_1+r_2-1)!}{(r_1)!(r_2)!}
    = \binom{r_1+r_2-1}{r_2} + 2\binom{r_1+r_2-1}{r_1}$
    and the notation $\altbinom{p}{q}\coloneqq \binom{p+q}{q}$
    was used.
  \end{Lem}
  Before applying this to $t_1=u_i$, $t_2=v_i$, $m=2n+k$, and $l=2$,
  recall the following special properties from
  \autoref{thm:twistedprod:cohomstructure} of the mentioned symbols in
  $\H^*(\Twistedprod{k}{X})$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $c^{k+1}=0$,
  \item $c\cdot e(\alpha_i)=0$, and
  \item $e(\alpha_i)^{r_1}d(\alpha_i)^{r_2} = 0$ for $r_1+2r_2>2n$,
    as $\H^{*>2n}(M\times M)=0$.
  \end{itemize}
  Then simplify in terms of $c$, $e(\alpha_i)$, $d(\alpha_i)$:
  \begin{align}\notag
    u_i^{2n+k} + v_i^{2n+k}
    &= \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=2n+k}}
      \altbinom{r_1-1}{r_2} (u_i+v_i)^{r_1}(u_iv_i)^{r_2} \\\notag
    &\equalsby{Def.} \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=2n+k}}
      \altbinom{r_1-1}{r_2}
      (c+e(\alpha_i))^{r_1}d(\alpha_i)^{r_2} \\\notag
    &\equalsby{$c\cdot e(\alpha_i)=0$}
      \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=2n+k}} \altbinom{r_1-1}{r_2}
      \left(c^{r_1}d(\alpha_i)^{r_2}+e(\alpha_i)^{r_1}d(\alpha_i)^{r_2}\right) \\\notag
    &\equalsby{$c^{k+1}=0$, $d(\alpha_i)^{n+s}=0$}
      \altbinom{k-1}{n} c^k d(\alpha_i)^n
      + \sum_{\mathclap{r_1+2r_2=2n+k}} \altbinom{r_1-1}{r_2}
      e(\alpha_i)^{r_1}d(\alpha_i)^{r_2} \\
    \label{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:1}
    &= \altbinom{k-1}{n} c^k d(\alpha_i)^n      
  \end{align}
  Altogether it turns out that
  \begin{align*}
    \pb{\Twistedprod{k}{f}}\s{(2n+k)}(\Twistedprod{k}{M})
    &\cequalsby{\eqref{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:sDkM}}
      (k+1)c^{2n+k} + \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i^{2n+k} + v_i^{2n+k}) \\
    &\equalsby{$c^{k+1}=0$}
      \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i^{2n+k} + v_i^{2n+k}) \\
    &\equalsby{\eqref{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:1}}
      \sum_{i=1}^n \altbinom{k-1}{n} c^k d(\alpha_i)^n \\
    &= \altbinom{k-1}{n} c^k d(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^n) \\
    &\equalsby{\eqref{eq:lem:twistedprod:indecompcriterion:sM}}
      \altbinom{k-1}{n} c^k d(\pb f \s{(n)}(M))
  \end{align*}
  as was stated.
\end{proof}

\subsection
[A Convenient Generating Set of the Cobordism Ring]
{A Convenient Generating Set of $\c_*$}
Now one can define candidates for the desired basis using the twisted
product construction to finally prove
Brown's theorem~\autoref{thm:brown}. 

Beforehands, recall from \autoref{thm:twistedprod:indecompcriterion}
that one has to both choose the dimension cobination, as well as the
factor of a twisted product correctly, in order to obtain an
indecomposable class representative.
For the correct dimension choice note, that any integer $m$ with
binary representation
\begin{gather*}
  m=2^{i_1}+\dotsb+2^{i_l}
  \;,\qquad
  0 \leq i_1<\dotsb<i_r
\end{gather*}
can be written as $m=2^{i_1}+2n\eqqcolon k+2n$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $n=0$ for $l=1$, else $n=2^{i_2-1}+\dotsb+2^{i_l-1}$
\item $\alpha(m)=\alpha(n)+1$.
\item For $m$ not of the form $2^s-1$, $n$ will also not be of the
  form $2^s-1$.
\end{itemize}
This is favourable because the binomial coefficient
$\binom{k-1}{n}$ will never be zero modulo two by the following Lemma,
as is required by the indecomposability criterion for twisted products
in \autoref{thm:twistedprod:indecompcriterion}.
\begin{Lem}
  For $a,b\in\Nat$, $\binom{a}{b}$ will be non-zero modulo 2 if and only
  if $\alpha(a+b)=\alpha(a)+\alpha(b)$.
  \begin{proof}
    This is a direct consequence from Lucas' Theorem % TODO: ref
    stating
    \begin{gather*}
      \binom{a+b}{b} \equiv \prod_{i=0}^s \binom{a_i+b_i}{b_i} \mod 2
    \end{gather*}
    where $a=\sum_{i=1}^s a_i2^{i}$, $b=\sum_{i=1}^s b_i2^{i}$ are the
    binary expansions of $a$ and $b$, and $\binom{0}{1}\coloneqq 0$.
    But this expression will only be non-zero, if $b_i$ is one for any
    $i$ where $a_i+b_i$ is one. In other words, if and only if
    $\alpha(a+b)=\sum_{i=1}^s(a_i+b_i)$.    
  \end{proof}
\end{Lem}
This can be applied to the combination $k-1$, $n$ from above, as one
simply calculates
\begin{align*}
  \alpha(k-1+n)
  &= \alpha\left((2^{i_1}-1)+ (2^{i_2-1}+\dotsb+2^{i_l-1})\right) \\
  &= \alpha\left(1+2^1+\dotsb 2^{i_1-1} + 2^{i_2-1}+\dotsb+2^{i_l-1}\right) \\
  &\equalsby{$i_1<i_2$}
  \alpha\left(1+2^1+\dotsb 2^{i_1-1}) + \alpha(2^{i_2-1}+\dotsb+2^{i_l-1}\right)\\
  &= \alpha(k-1) + \alpha(n)
\end{align*}

Now define the basis representatives as follows.
\begin{Thm}\label{thm:brown}
  Consider the manifolds $\G m$ for $m\neq 2^s-1\in\Nat$ that are
  defined by
  \begin{align*}
    \G 0 &\coloneqq \pt \;, \\
    \G m &\coloneqq \Twistedprod{2^{i_1}}{\G n}
        &\text{
          where
          $\textstyle m=\sum_{r=1}^l 2^{i_r}=2^{i_1}+2n$
          with $0\leq i_1<\dotsb<i_l$.
          }
          \;.
  \end{align*}
  Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:brownimmersionproperty} $\G m$ immerses into $\R^{2m-\alpha(m)}$.
  \item The cobordism classes of the $\G m$, $m\neq 2^s-1$, are
    indecomposable, and thus % TODO: ref
    \begin{gather*}
      \c_*\cong \left( [\G m] \,\big|\, m\neq 2^s-1 \right)_{\Zmod2}
      = \Zmod2\left[[\G m] \,\big|\, m\neq 2^s-1\right]
    \end{gather*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}
The proof of the two parts is splitted into the subsequent sections.

\subsubsection{Immersion Property}

\begin{proof}[proof of
  \itemref{thm:brown}{item:brownimmersionproperty}]
  \optcite[p.~84, proof Thm.~1.30]{immersionconj}
  In order to proof the immersion property of the manifolds $\G m$,
  conduct an induction over $\alpha(m)$.
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\alpha(m)=1$:]
    As an induction start note that in the case of $m=2^i$ one has
    \begin{gather*}
      \G m
      =\Twistedprod{2^i}{\G 0}
      =\Twistedprod{2^i}{\pt}
      =\RP{2^i}
    \end{gather*}
    which immerses into $\R^{2m-1}=\R^{2m-\alpha(m)}$ by
    Whitney's immersion theorem. % TODO: ref
  \item[$\alpha(m)\geq2$:]
    For the induction step write $m=2^{i_1}+2n$ as above, and assume
    there is an immersion
    \begin{gather*}
      \iota\colon\G n \immlongto \R^{2n-\alpha(n)}
      \;.
    \end{gather*}
  \end{description}
  As described in
  \itemref{rem:twistedprodproperties}{item:twistedprodpreservesimmersions}
  this induces an immersion of twisted products
  \begin{gather*}
    1\times\iota\times\iota\colon
    \G m
    = \Sphere{2^{i_1}} \times \G n\times \G n/\sim
    \immlongto
    \Sphere{2^{i_1}} \times \R^{2n-\alpha(n)} \times \R^{2n-\alpha(n)}/\sim
    = \Twistedprod{2^{i_1}}{\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}}
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
  The latter twisted product however is a fibre bundle over
  $\RP{2^i_1}$ as in
  \itemref{rem:twistedprodproperties}{item:twistedprodfibrebdl},
  more precisely a vector bundle of dimension $4n-2\alpha(n)$.
  The needed immersion will be given by the following Lemma.
  \begin{Lem}
    \optcite[compare Prop. 4.3]{brown}
    The total space of a vector bundle $E\to M^n$ of rank $k$ over a
    closed manifold of dimension $n$ can be immersed into $\R^{2n+k}$.
  \end{Lem}
  One calculates
  \begin{align*}
    2\cdot 2^{i_1} + \left(4n-2\alpha(n)\right)
    &= 2\cdot (2^{i_1}+2n) - 2\alpha(n) \\
    &= 2m - 2\alpha(n) \\
    &= 2m - 2\alpha(m)+2 \\
    &\leqby{m\geq 2}
    2m - \alpha(m)
    \;,
  \end{align*}
  so altogether one gets the immersion
  \begin{gather*}
    \G m
    \immlongto \Twistedprod{2^{i_1}}{\R^{2n-\alpha(n)}}
    \immlongto \R^{2m - \alpha(m)}
    \;.
  \end{gather*}
